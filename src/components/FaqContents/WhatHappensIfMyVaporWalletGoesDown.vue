    <p>
      MyVaporWallet is not a web wallet. You don't have a login, and nothing ever
      gets saved to our servers. It is simply an interface that allows you to
      interact with the blockchain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If MyVaporWallet.com goes down, you would have to find another way
      (like gvap or Vapory Wallet / Mist) to do what we are doing. But you wouldn't
      have to "get" your Vapor out of MyVaporWallet because it's not in MyVaporWallet.
      It's in whatever wallet your generated via our site.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can import your unencrypted private key and your Gvap/Mist Format
      (encrypted) files directly into gvap / Vapory Wallet / Mist very easily.
    </p>

      You can also run
      <a href="https://kb.myvaporwallet.com/offline/running-myvaporwallet-locally.html">
        MyVaporWallet locally
      </a>
      and/or
      <a href="https://kb.myvaporwallet.com/networks/run-your-own-node-with-myvaporwallet.html">
        connect it to your own node
      </a>.
